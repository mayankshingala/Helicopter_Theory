Programmed a coupled trim solution for the helicopter 

1. Blade flap equation:
   I. Blade hub shear forces and moments in the rotating frame of reference as a function of azimuth ψ.
   II. Variation of non-dimensional rotating frame vertical shear force as a function of ψ for all four blades.
   III. Graph of variation of forces and moments in fixed frame of reference as a function of ψ.

2. Free flight coupled trim analysis for µ varying from 0 to 0.45
   I. The variation of control angles, θ0, θ1s, θ1s vs. µ
   II. The variation of vehicle shaft angles αs and ϕs vs. µ
